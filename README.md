# emacs.d

My emacs configuration, hardly useful to anyone else. Most likely got
whole lot of old cruft lying around, will be cleaned up in due time
I'm sure ;)

Making this public in case someone else would find it useful.

# Installation

Run `setup.sh` and it'll configure a `~/.emacs` file to read all
configuration from this folders `emacs` file.
